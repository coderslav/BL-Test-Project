### Project launch guide

> Before you start, make sure that you have Docker installed ( [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) ). And run it

-   Clone this project to your computer
-   Use the terminal to go to the root folder *BL_TEST_PROJECT*. In this folder there should be a file called *docker-compose.yml*
-   Run the command: ```docker-compose build```
-   The build process takes some time. Please wait
-   After the build is completed, enter the following command: ```docker-compose up```
-   Wait until the project starts. This process is usually faster than build, but the first launch takes some time
-   When the project is fully launched, you can use it

### Project usage guide

-   Open your browser and follow the link http://127.0.0.1:3000 or http://localhost:3000
-   To use sorting, just click on the header of the column you want to sort (sorting works in descending and ascending order)
-   For realty details, click on the title of the realty that you are interested in
-   The rest of the usage should be intuitive. Enjoy ðŸ™‚

### Notes

-   I had to replace the Django library **psycopg2-binary 2.8.6** that was in the mission specs (*requirements.txt*) with a newer one **psycopg2-binary 2.9.3**. Reason: incompatibility and numerous errors during server startup
-   The description of the mission is in the adjacent file called *MISSION.md*
-   The project also includes Backend tests. To execute them, go to the CLI of the launched Backend container and run the following command: ```python manage.py test```
